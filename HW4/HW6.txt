Is memory allocated for an array variable when it is declared? When is the memory allocated for an array?

Yes, memory is always allocated for an array when it is created. In a double or int array, the unedited data will be 0, and in strings it
will just appear as a null string "". Memory is always allocated for the size of the array, regardless of whether it is initialized
through Object[] name = new Object[x] or through putting in actual values.

What is the printout of the following code? Why x is not the same as numbers.length?

int x = 10;
int[] numbers = new int[x];
x = 60;
System.out.println("x is " + x);
System.out.println("The size of numbers is " + numbers.length);

x is 60
The size of numbers is 10

x is changed after int[] numbers is initialized so the length of numbers (10), will not change while the value of x will change (to 60).
